## Read the research that has sparked a Bitcoin Renaissance

ZK-rollups on Bitcoin were a pipe-dream until this year. But with the recent research around the subject, and the growing excitement around Bitcoin during the recent Ordinals craze, teams are now Let's dive into the research. If you need to catch up on the latest research, check out this guide to get you up to date on all the information you need to know around zk-rollups on Bitcoin.You can also find some research pieces and code repositories After reviewing that guide, we list some more resources for you to dive into.

## The tl;dr on Bitcoin rollup R&D

In 2022, the Human Rights Foundation and Starkware put out an RFP for a research fellowship. The fellowship was tasked with covering if, or if not, zk-rollups would be beneficial to Bitcoin.It asked a number of questions around zk-rollups improving Bitcoin scaling, privacy and user experience. John Light was awarded the fellowship and produced the first and most comprehensive research report on the subject.When catching up on R&DÂ around Bitcoin rollups, the first thing you should do is:

- [Read the research report "Validity rollups on Bitcoin"](https://bitcoinrollups.org/)

### Understand what is enabling development

Earlier in 2023, the Bitcoin protocol saw a spike in usage due to new interest in Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Let's cover the two things that enabled this.The Ordinal protocol is a tracking system that assigns a number to a single satoshi (a denomination of Bitcoin). Inscriptions are the result of inscribing digital artifacts to specific satoshis. The Ordinal protocol enables inscriptions by combining compontents of two protocol upgrades to Bitcoin, "Taproot" and "SegWit". SegWit can see more data be stored in a Bitcoin block, up to 4 MB when comprised of arbitrary data. And Taproot enables inscribing a single file, just below this 4 MB limit, to a single satoshi.

### Where rollups come into play

So with this ability to store (a little less than) 4 MB of arbitrary data in a Bitcoin block, you can do a lot of cool stuff. Teams are now researching and implementing ways for developers to use these data blobs to post rollup transaction data to Bitcoin.Rollkit released a framework for developers to launch sovereign rollups using Bitcoin for data availability and consensus. Within this framework, you can launch rollups with different execution environments and potentially add features like Zcash-level privacy. The rollups handle their own settlement and execution, and they use Bitcoin for data availability and consensus.Now other teams are exploring how they can use the Ordinal protocol deploy build sovereign rollups on Bitcoin. Chainway, who maintains a Bitcoin data availability adapter, is looking to launch the first in-production zk-rollup on Bitcoin. Kasar Labs, in partnership with Bitcoin NFT project "Taproot Wizards", is looking to launch a Bitcoin zk-rollup leveraging the Starknet stack and Chainway's DA adapter.To get up to date on the development of zk-rollups on Bitcoin, you should read the following:
